# Coursera Machine Learning Regression

These are my lab solutions for the Coursera Machine Learning Regression course.  To run the code, Anaconda stack plus 
Dato Graphlab Create is required.

- Lab 1: implementation and application of  simple linear regression
- Lab 2:  implementation and application of  multiple linear regression, gradient descent is used to find the regression parameters
- Lab 4:  implementation and application of  ridge regression, gradient descent is used to find the regression parameters
- Lab 5:  implementation and application of  lasso regression, coordinate descent is used to find the regression parameters
- Lab 6:  implementation and application of  k-nearest neigbors regression
